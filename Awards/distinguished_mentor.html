<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>The recipients should be individuals who have made lifelong efforts dedicated to the mentoring of trainees in the field of gastroenterology. Contributions to the AGA are also valued. Candidates for this award must be AGA members at the time of

    and academic-based chiefs of medicine; GI division chiefs and training directors of major academic institutions; and trainee members of AGA.</p>

<h2>Process of Selection</h2>

<p>The selection committee is comprised of the chair of the AGA Institute Research Policy Committee, two members of the research policy committee and three past distinguished mentor award recipients. All appointments are made by the chair of the
