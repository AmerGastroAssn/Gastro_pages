<h5>Established in 1968, the Distinguished Achievement Award in Basic Science will recognize a senior investigator who has made major accomplishments in basic science research that has significantly advanced the science and/or practice of
    gastroenterology. For the purpose of this award, the term gastroenterology encompasses any gastrointestinal discipline, including hepatology.</h5>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Eligibility and Standards</h2>

<p>AGA membership is not required to be considered for this award. The recipient must be an individual with a coherent and substantial body of important basic research in gastroenterology. Nominees need not be gastroenterologists; consideration will
    be given to scientists and medical professionals from all fields, however, the nominee&rsquo;s contributions must have significantly impacted the understanding of basic biology as it relates to the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<h2>Solicitation of Nominations</h2>

<p>Nominations are solicited by the AGA Chair via a &ldquo;Call for Nominations&rdquo; in July to the following constituencies: AGA Governing Board, council section chairs, committee chairs, task force chairs and membership-at-large, deans of U.S.
    medical schools and academic-based chiefs of medicine, GI division chiefs and training directors of major academic institutions, editors of major medical journals and presidents of international GI societies.</p>

<h2>Process of Selection</h2>

<p>The recipient is selected by the following, which serve as permanent selection committee members: AGA Chair (serves as committee chair), chair of the AGA Institute Research Policy Committee, chair of the AGA Institute Research Awards Panel, editor
    of Gastroenterology, editor of Cellular and Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology (CMGH), and two members-at-large selected by the AGA Chair, a senior U.S.-based basic research investigator and a non-U.S.-based basic research investigator.
    Selection committee members may not nominate or second an AGA member&rsquo;s nomination for this award.</p>

<p>The selection committee&rsquo;s recommendation is presented at the February AGA Governing Board meeting for ratification.</p>

<h2>Award Recognition</h2>

<p>The award recipient will receive a $5,000 honorarium, plus reimbursement of expenses to attend DDW, and an engraved award, which will be presented during Digestive Disease Week (DDW).* The recipient and his/her spouse will be reimbursed for travel
    (coach) and hotel accommodations for up to two nights.</p>

<p>The nomination deadline is midnight November 6. The nomination package must contain the following: curriculum vitae or resume, one nomination letter and a one-page seconding letter. The nomination letter, maximum three pages, must identify the
    individual&rsquo;s achievements in clinical or translational digestive disease research and the significance thereof to the advancement of gastroenterology. The nomination letter may include multiple signatories. Additional nomination or seconding
    letters will not be reviewed. All required documents must be combined into one PDF file and emailed to awards@gastro.org. The nomination file must be titled by the nominee&rsquo;s last name and first initial. Hard copies will not be accepted.
    Nominations are not carried over year to year. Please forward all questions about this and other AGA recognition awards to (301) 222-4012 or via e-mail at awards@gastro.org.</p>
