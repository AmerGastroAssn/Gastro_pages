        <h2>Session 2: Small and Large Intestine</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="long">
        <p>Starting in 2019 physicians will begin participating in either the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) or an Alternative Payment Model (APM) to earn additional increases in their Medicare payments. There is quite a bit of rulemaking that
            will be taking place to lay out the details of each of these payment tracks; however, it is fully expected that the measurement/ reporting periods for MIPS and APMs will take place starting as early as 2017. Physicians, or their practices, will have
            the opportunity to decide annually which program in which they will be participating.</p>

        <h2>Session 3: Pancreas and Liver</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="long">
        <p>From January 2016 through December 2019 all physicians will receive a 0.5 percent payment increase each year on their Medicare reimbursements&mdash;and starting in 2019, this baseline will be the starting point for incentives from either the MIPS
            or APM payment track. Then, starting in January 2020 there will no longer be automatic baseline payment increases each year. For those in the MIPS program, the payment adjustments will be exclusively based on performance within MIPS (these payment
            adjustments are described in more detail below). For those that participate in the APM track, from January 2019 through December 2024, physicians will receive a positive 5 percent bonus payment on their Medicare fee-for-service reimbursements, as
            well as any incentives that are built into their APM (e.g., care coordination or infrastructure payments, shared savings, etc.). Then, starting in 2026, physicians in the APM track will receive a 0.75 percent baseline payment increase on their
            Medicare fee-for-service reimbursements indefinitely&mdash;as well as any ongoing incentives that are part of their APM.</p>
