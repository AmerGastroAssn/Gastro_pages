The US Multi-Society  Task Force has developed  updated recommendations to guide health care providers with the surveillance  of  patients  after  colorectal  cancer  (CRC) resection with curative intent. This document is based on a critical review of the literature regarding the role of colo- noscopy,flexible  sigmoidoscopy,  endoscopic  ultrasound, fecal  testing  and  CT  colonography  in  this  setting.  The document addresses the effect of surveillance, with focus on colonoscopy, on patient survival after CRC resection, the appropriate use and timing of colonoscopy for periopera- tive  clearing  and  for  postoperative  prevention  of  meta- chronous CRC, specific considerations for the detection of local recurrence in the case of rectal cancer, as well as the place  of  CT  colonography  and  fecal  tests  in  post-CRC surveillance.

In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women combined.1 Of the estimated 132,700 new cases ex- pected to be diagnosed in 2015, 1 70% 80% will undergo surgical resection with curative intent 2,3 and up to 40% of patients with locoregional disease will develop recurrent cancer, of which 90% will occur within 5 years. 4 The post-operative surveillance of patients treated for CRC is intended to prolong survival by diagnosing recurrent and metachro- nous cancers at a curable stage, and to prevent metachronous cancer by detection and removal of precancerous polyps. Surveillance strategies employ a combination of modal- ities, including history and physical examination, carci- noembryonic antigen (CEA), computed tomography (CT) scans, and endoluminal imaging, including colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and CT colo- nography (CTC). Although the optimal surveillance strategy is still not clearly defined, the role of colonoscopy is pri- marily to clear the colon of synchronous cancers and polyps and prevent metachronous neoplasms.

In 2006, the US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) published a consensus guideline to address the use of endoscopy for patients after CRC resection. 5 This updated document focuses on the role of colonoscopy in patients after CRC resection. Additionally, based on a comprehensive literature review updated from the 2006 recommendations, we review the possible adjunctive roles of fecal testing (eg, fecal immunochemical testing for hemoglobin) and CTC. The use of CEA, CT scans of the liver, as well as chest radio- graphs are beyond the scope of this document and are not reviewed. The goal of this consensus document is to provide a critical review of the literature and recommendations regarding the role of colonoscopy, fl exible sigmoidoscopy, EUS, fecal testing, and CTC in surveillance after surgical resection of CRC.

Methodology Literature Review The English-language medical literature was searched using MEDLINE (2005 to September 30, 2015), EMBASE (2005 to September 30, 2015), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews and Effects (2005 to October 7, 2015), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005 to October 7, 2015). In MEDLINE, subject headings for colorectal neoplasms were combined with the subheading for surgery, resection, postoperative, colectomy, curative, survivor, survival, neoplasm recurrence, second pri- mary neoplasms, and treatment outcome. The resulting set was combined with subject and keywords for colonoscopy or follow- up studies. Similar searches were performed in EMBASE, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews and Effects, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Case reports and studies per- formed in patients with in fl ammatory bowel disease, prior CRC, or hereditary CRC syndromes were excluded. Review papers, meta-analyses, gastroenterology textbooks, and editorials were searched manually for additional references. Data from studies with no explicit documentation that perioperative colonoscopic clearing had been performed were not included in the overall summary tables, but some of these studies are referred to in the discussion of the evidence. The review includes studies pub- lished since 2005, but also incorporates older evidence used to draft the 2006 guidelines. 5 Evidence-based recommendations are provided with supporting discussion to help guide clinicians in the management of these patients.

De fi nitions The review focused on the use of colonoscopy after surgical resection in patients with TNM stages I  III (or Dukes A  C) CRC, and selected patients with resected stage IV cancer. 6 When available, we included studies with speci fi c reporting of overall and cancer-speci fi c survival, and rates of second primary (meta- chronous) cancers and anastomotic recurrences. Although signif- icant variability exists in the terminology of the reviewed studies, the following general de fi nitions were employed: metachronous cancer refers to CRC diagnosed as a second primary after surgical resection and perioperative clearing, and anastomotic recurrence includes CRC which recurs intraluminally at or within close proximity of the surgical anastomosis. Rectal cancer is generally associated with a higher risk of local recurrence than cancer in other segments of the colon, and requires additional considerations for surveillance, which are discussed in more detail in a separate section. Throughout the document, reference is made to " high- quality " colonoscopy for perioperative clearing and surveil- lance for metachronous neoplasms. A high-quality colonoscopy assumes completeness (cecum or anastomosis is reached), adequate bowel preparation, and meticulous examination by appropriately trained operators who meet adenoma detection benchmarks (ie, frequency of conventional adenoma detection of  25% in average-risk screening colonoscopies). 7,8 Process and Levels of Evidence The USMSTF includes gastroenterology experts with speci fi c interest in CRC. These members represent the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Associa- tion, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Summary tables and a draft document were circulated to mem- bers of the Task Force, and fi nal guidelines were developed by consensus during a joint teleconference. The document under- went committee review and governing board approval by all 3 societies. The USMSTF grades the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations using an adaptation of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. 9 The GRADE process categorizes the quality of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low ( Table 1 ). This categorization is based on an assessment of the study design (eg, randomized controlled trial or observational study), study limitations, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evi- dence, imprecision, and publication bias. The USMSTF members conduct literature searches to identify published papers that address the key issues discussed within these recommendations. These publications are supplemented both by review of citations from the identi fi ed papers as well as other key references elicited from the subject matter experts on the Task Force. The GRADE process involves the collection of literature, analysis, summary (often as meta-analysis), and a separate review of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The USMSTF mem- bers employ a modi fi ed, qualitative approach for this assessment based on exhaustive and critical review of evidence, without a traditional meta-analysis. The GRADE process separates evalu- ation of the quality of the evidence to support a recommendation from the strength of that recommendation. This is done in recognition of the fact that, although the quality of the evidence impacts the strength of the recommendation, other factors can in fl uence a recommendation, such as side effects, patient pref- erences, values, and cost. Strong recommendations mean that most informed patients would choose the recommended man- agement and that clinicians can structure their interactions with patients accordingly. Weak recommendations mean that pa- tients ' choices will vary according to their values and prefer- ences, and clinicians must ensure that patients ' care is in keeping with their values and preferences. 9 Weaker recommendations are indicated by phrases such as " we suggest, " whereas stronger recommendations are stated as " we recommend."

Results of Literature Review Effect of Surveillance Colonoscopy on Survival Observational  studies  utilizing  large  administrative databases 10 – 12 and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 13,14 show that patients who receive surveillance colonoscopy after CRC resection have lower overall, 10 – 14 but not disease-speci fi c 11,14 mortality.
