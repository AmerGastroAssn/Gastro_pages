combined with subject and keywords for colonoscopy or follow-
up studies. Similar searches were performed in EMBASE, the
Database of Abstracts of Reviews and Effects, and the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews. Case reports and studies per-
formed in patients with in

ammatory bowel disease, prior CRC,
or hereditary CRC syndromes were excluded. Review papers,
meta-analyses, gastroenterology textbooks, and editorials were
searched manually for additional references. Data from studies
with no explicit documentation that perioperative colonoscopic
clearing had been performed were not included in the overall
summary tables, but some of these studies are referred to in the
discussion of the evidence. The review includes studies pub-
lished since 2005, but also incorporates older evidence used to
draft the 2006 guidelines.

The review focused on the use of colonoscopy after surgical
resection in patients with TNM stages I

III (or Dukes A

C) CRC,
and selected patients with resected stage IV cancer.
6
When
available, we included studies with speci
fi
c reporting of overall
and cancer-speci
fi
c survival, and rates of second primary (meta-
chronous) cancers and anastomotic recurrences. Although signif-
icant variability exists in the terminology of the reviewed studies,
the following general de
fi
nitions were employed: metachronous
cancer refers to CRC diagnosed as a second primary after surgical
resection and perioperative clearing, and anastomotic recurrence
includes CRC which recurs intraluminally at or within close
proximity of the surgical anastomosis.
Rectal cancer is generally associated with a higher risk of
local recurrence than cancer in other segments of the colon, and
requires additional considerations for surveillance, which are
discussed in more detail in a separate section.
Throughout the document, reference is made to
“
high-
quality
”
colonoscopy for perioperative clearing and surveil-
lance for metachronous neoplasms. A high-quality colonoscopy
assumes completeness (cecum or anastomosis is reached),
adequate bowel preparation, and meticulous examination by
appropriately trained operators who meet adenoma detection
benchmarks (ie, frequency of conventional adenoma detection
of

25% in average-risk screening colonoscopies).

Process and Levels of Evidence
The USMSTF includes gastroenterology experts with speci
fi
c
interest in CRC. These members represent the American College
of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Associa-
tion, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.
Summary tables and a draft document were circulated to mem-
bers of the Task Force, and
fi
nal guidelines were developed by
consensus during a joint teleconference. The document under-
went committee review and governing board approval by all 3
societies. The USMSTF grades the quality of evidence and
strength of recommendations using an adaptation of the Grading
of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) approach.
9
The GRADE process categorizes the quality
of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low (
Table 1
).
This categorization is based on an assessment of the study
design (eg, randomized controlled trial or observational study),
study limitations, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evi-
dence, imprecision, and publication bias. The USMSTF members
conduct literature searches to identify published papers that
address the key issues discussed within these recommendations.
These publications are supplemented both by review of citations
from the identi
fi
ed papers as well as other key references elicited
from the subject matter experts on the Task Force. The GRADE
process involves the collection of literature, analysis, summary
(often as meta-analysis), and a separate review of the quality of
evidence and strength of recommendations. The USMSTF mem-
bers employ a modi
fi
ed, qualitative approach for this assessment
based on exhaustive and critical review of evidence, without a
traditional meta-analysis. The GRADE process separates evalu-
ation of the quality of the evidence to support a recommendation
from the strength of that recommendation. This is done in
recognition of the fact that, although the quality of the evidence
impacts the strength of the recommendation, other factors can
in
fl
uence a recommendation, such as side effects, patient pref-
erences, values, and cost. Strong recommendations mean that
most informed patients would choose the recommended man-
agement and that clinicians can structure their interactions with
patients accordingly. Weak recommendations mean that pa-
tients
’
choices will vary according to their values and prefer-
ences, and clinicians must ensure that patients
’
care is in keeping
with their values and preferences.

Possibleexplanations for thediscrepancies betweenall-cause

leading physicians to select healthier patients for colono-

Colonoscopy is one of several modalities used in the
surveillance of CRC patients after curative-intent surgical
resection, and the impact of colonoscopy on patient out-
comes cannot be discussed without considering the broader
context of other co-interventions. The modalities used for
surveillance include a combination of medical examinations,
CEA measurements, radiologic imaging, and colonoscopy.
To date, 11 RCTs that enrolled
>
4000 patients have
compared different surveillance regimens.

The sur-
veillance strategies (test selection and frequency of admin-
istration)  used  in  these  RCTs  were  heterogeneous,
complicating  the  drawing  of  de
fi

regarding the optimal use of individual tests and their effect
on patient outcomes.
28,29
Furthermore, some the
fi
ndings
may be less relevant to contemporary surveillance recom-
mendations because several of the RCTs enrolled patients in
the 1980s and 1990s. Since then, there have been important
improvements in surgical technique (such as total meso-
rectal excision for rectal cancer), CT imaging technology to
detect recurrences earlier, and the use of chemotherapy (for
stage III and certain stage II patients, and to downstage
patients with previously unresectable disease).

although intensive multimodality surveillance is associated
with increased overall survival and earlier detection of
cancer recurrence, these bene
fi
ts are most apparent in
studies using frequent CEA measurements to detect recur-
rent disease.

ing (such as CT to detect liver metastases) has been

analyses. The
recently published FACS (Follow Up After Colorectal Sur-

25
RCT reported that intensive imaging with CT of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and CEA measurement were
each associated with increased rates of surgical resection of
recurrences with curative intent, but not improved survival
compared with minimal follow-up. Conversely, annual or
more frequent surveillance colonoscopy has not been shown
to improve survival.
13,22,26,36
This is not surprising because
the rates of intraluminal or anastomotic recurrences are
low, particularly for cancer proximal to the rectum, and
usually associated with extraluminal disease that is not
amenable to curative surgical resection. Increasing the in-
tensity of surveillance colonoscopy solely to detect intra-
luminal disease is unlikely bene
fi
cial.
5,36
A recently published RCT conducted in China provides
additional information regarding colonoscopy surveillance
after CRC resection.
26
In this trial, 326 patients undergoing
surgery for CRC were randomized to either intensive colo-
noscopic surveillance (ie, colonoscopy at 3-month intervals
for 1 year, at 6-month intervals for the next 2 years,
and once a year subsequently), or routine colonoscopic
surveillance (ie, colonoscopy at 6, 30, and 60 months
postoperatively).  All  patients  underwent  preoperative
colonoscopy (or within 6 months postoperatively), and
similar non-colonoscopic surveillance (ie, medical history
and examination, CEA, chest x-ray, and CT or ultrasound of
the liver), and were followed until the date of last visit or
death. There were no differences in overall 5-year survival
rates (77% in the intensive colonoscopic surveillance group
vs 72% in the routine colonoscopic surveillance group;
P
¼
.25). Although the authors stated that intensive colo-
noscopic surveillance improved the prognosis of patients
with symptomatic postoperative CRC, others have suggested
lead-time bias as explanation.
37
Furthermore, the higher
rate of reoperation has been observed in other studies
comparing intensity of surveillance strategies; this might be
due to intervention bias, which can occur when clinicians
not blinded to randomization arm make decisions regarding
the selection of patients for reoperation.
16
Of note, there
were 3 complications in the intensive colonoscopic sur-
veillance group (2 cases of hemorrhage requiring hospital-
ization and 1 perforation requiring laparotomy) and none in
the routine colonoscopic surveillance group. These rates are
similar to those reported in an older RCT.
22
Thus, increased
intensity of surveillance colonoscopy after curative resec-
tion of CRC
38
does not produce better outcomes, and might
increase harm to some patients.
In summary, the evidence shows that although post-
operative colonoscopy is associated with improved overall
survival, there is no effect on cancer-speci
fi
c death, and no
survival bene
fi
t associated with frequent performance of sur-

Colonoscopy and Perioperative
Clearing in Patients With Cancer
of the Colon or Rectum
The critical importance of a complete high-quality colo-
noscopy to exclude synchronous tumors and
fi
nd and resect
polyps in patients with CRC cannot be overemphasized. In
patients with CRC, the prevalence of synchronous cancers
ranges from 0.7% % to about 7%.
39
–
48
Colonoscopy is
preferably performed preoperatively
49
; however, it can be
deferred for 3 to 6 months postoperatively if colonoscopy is
incomplete due to malignant obstruction. The 3-month
lower limit is intended to provide patients with suf
fi
cient
time for postoperative recovery. Intraoperative colonoscopy
has been proposed as an alternative approach,
50
although
not commonly practiced.
Available evidence indicates that perioperative colonos-
copy should be meticulous, with the goal of detecting both
synchronous cancers and precancerous lesions. Finding and
resecting synchronous precancerous polyps in patients with
CRC to prevent metachronous neoplasia is highly relevant.
Considerable evidence indicates that signi
fi
cant neoplastic
lesions can be missed during colonoscopy. The quality of the
baseline examination, measured by the adenoma detection
rate, is directly associated with the risk of development of,
and death from, interval CRC.
51,52
Variable colonoscopy
quality has also been demonstrated with respect to the
completeness of polypectomy.
53
In fact, the great majority of
interval CRC cases are attributed to missed lesions or
incomplete polyp resection.
54
The issues regarding vari-
ability in colonoscopy quality, and the negative impact of
this variability on protection from CRC described in
average-risk cohorts, are potentially even more relevant in
the higher-risk CRC patients. A large population-based study
utilizing the Netherlands Cancer Registry employed an
adjudication algorithm to ascribe likely etiology for meta-
chronous CRC in a cohort of 5157 patients with CRC.
47
There were 93 (1.8%) metachronous cancers diagnosed
between 7 and 356 months after the initial CRC diagnosis
(40.8% diagnosed within 36 months), and these were
attributed to missed lesions in 43%, nonadherence to sur-
veillance recommendations in 43%, and incomplete resec-
tion in 5.4%; de novo cancers accounted for only 5.4%.
Several studies show that patients with CRC and synchro-
nous adenomas or advanced adenomas have a higher risk of

underscoring the importance of adequate perioperative co-
lonoscopy. The role of CTC in the perioperative setting is
discussed in the section
“
Alternatives and Adjuncts to Co-
lonoscopy,
”
but the case of obstructive CRC precluding
preoperative colonoscopy and perioperative clearing done
by CTC deserves additional comment. In this context,
choosing colonoscopy instead of CTC for the
fi
rst post-
operative examination is prudent because synchronous
diminutive and
fl
at neoplastic lesions, which might be
missed or not reported by CTC, are potentially highly rele-
vant in a patient with CRC. Recently, serrated polyposis
syndrome (SPS) has been recognized as the most common
polyp syndrome, and is associated with an increased risk of
CRC in both the right and left colon. In patients with SPS and
CRC, SPS has usually been recognized at the colonoscopy
that diagnosed CRC or during surveillance after CRC resec-
tion.
62
Because patients with SPS should undergo colonos-
copy at more frequent intervals,
63,64
this underscores the
importance of colonoscopist awareness of SPS and consid-
eration of SPS diagnosis in patients with multiple and/or
large serrated lesions.
Recommendation:
We recommend that patients with
CRC undergo high-quality perioperative clearing with colo-
noscopy. The procedure should be performed preopera-
tively, or within a 3- to 6-month interval after surgery in the
case of obstructive CRC. The goals of perioperative clearing
colonoscopy are detection of synchronous cancer and
detection and complete resection of precancerous polyps.
Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence
Colonoscopy and Prevention of
Metachronous Cancer After Surgery
for Colon and for Rectal Cancer
Colonoscopy is the procedure of choice for the detection
of intraluminal metachronous CRCs. Pooled data from
studies selected for this review (
Supplementary Tables 1
and
2
) show that approximately two-thirds of metachronous
cancers are asymptomatic, TNM stage I or II (or Dukes stage
A or B), and reoperated with curative intent. Data from
population-based registries suggest that metachronous CRCs
are being diagnosed at earlier stages, possibly re
fl
ecting the
effect of increased surveillance.

The cumulative inci-
dence of metachronous cancers of the colon and rectum is
estimated to be about 0.3%

–
80
All colorectal segments are at
increased risk for a metachronous cancer, although some
studies suggest that among older survivors, the risk remains
elevated only in the proximal colon.
81
Thus, postoperative
colonoscopic surveillance in CRC patients is indicated long
term, or until the bene
fi
t is outweighed by decreased life
expectancy due to age and/or competing comorbidity.
The optimal intervals of surveillance colonoscopy after
CRC resection are not established by RCTs. However, several
studies report an increased incidence of cancers diagnosed
within the
fi
rst few years after surgery, despite seemingly
adequate perioperative colonoscopic clearance. In the post-
CRC resection studies included in this review, there were
253 (1.6%) metachronous cancers in 15,803 patients; when
timing could be determined, about 30% were detected within
2 years of resection of the index malignancy (
Supplementary
Table 2
). Several of these studies did not explicitly identify
patientswithLynchsyndrome,andinclusionofthesepatients
could have in
fl
ated some of the estimates of the rates of early
metachronous cancers.
60,82
The USMSTF recently recom-
mended that all CRCs be studied for evidence of Lynch syn-
drome.
83
The impact of not accounting for these patients is
uncertain (a similar concern exists for unrecognized SPS);
however, when the analysis was restricted to studies stating
that   patients   with   Lynch   syndrome   were
excluded,
26,42,46,71,76
the rate of metachronous cancers diag-
nosed within 3 years of surgery was about 33%. Recently
published, large, population-based cancer registry studies,
including ones that speci
fi
cally excluded patients with Lynch
syndrome,
47,66
report a high incidence of metachronous CRC
within the
fi
rst few years after surgery.
47,66,81,84
The most
plausible explanation is that many early, apparently meta-
chronous cancers are actually due to prevalent cancers or
advanced adenomas missed at the time of the primary ma-
lignancy diagnosis. The factors involved in the occurrence of
interval CRC are presumably the same in the case of missed
synchronous cancers and missed synchronous advanced ad-
enomas, and are likely related to the quality of the baseline
clearing examination. The consensus 2006 USMSTF guide-
lines recommended colonoscopy at 1 year after surgery (or
after the perioperative clearing colonoscopy), in addition to
high-quality perioperative clearing to exclude synchronous
neoplasia.
5
Studiespublishedsince2005showthatthe1-year
examination is high-yield and cost-effective.
85
In a study
conducted in a large health maintenance organization, 652
patients with curative resection for CRC and at least 1 colo-
noscopy were evaluated. Of those, 20 patients (3.1%) were
diagnosed with a second primary CRC, including 9 cancers
that were detected within 18 months of the initial cancer
diagnosis.
12
In the 5-year follow-up of the VA Cooperative
Study 380, 5 cancers were detected in patients who had CRC
diagnosed at baseline (n
¼
23), and 4 of 5 were found within
18 months.
86
One study
87
challenged the concept of per-
forming a colonoscopy at the 1-year interval: A review of a
subgroup of 155 CRC patients in a cancer registry with both a
complete preoperative and at least one complete post-
operative colonoscopy (performed at mean of 478
±
283
days) revealed no metachronous CRC cases. However, there
were 3 anastomotic recurrences and 24 patients with 28
adenomatous polyps; 5 of which were

1 cm. In the RCT
published by Wang et al,
26
5 of 9 metachronous cancers were
diagnosed within 3 years after surgery. This study provides
additional evidence that even with appropriate perioperative
clearing of the colon, some patients present a short time after
surgery with a second primary cancer, strengthening the
recommendation to perform colonoscopy 1 year after surgi-
cal resection of CRC.
The timing of subsequent surveillance examinations is
supported by weaker evidence, and is based largely on the
762   Kahi et al
Gastroenterology Vol. 150, No. 3
AGASECTION
approach to post-polypectomy surveillance of patients with
high-risk adenomas.
63
If the 1-year examination reveals no
neoplasia, colonoscopy should be performed after 3 years (4
years from CRC diagnosis or perioperative colonoscopy) and
if this examination
fi
nds no neoplasia, 5 years later (9 years
from CRC diagnosis or perioperative colonoscopy). Subse-
quent surveillance intervals should not exceed 5 years. If
polyps are found during any of the examinations, then the
interval for the next colonoscopy can be shortened, based on
guidelines for post-polypectomy surveillance.
63
Patients with
known or suspected Lynch syndrome due to tumor testing,
age at diagnosis, family history, and/or tumor characteristics
should be distinguished from patients with sporadic CRC and
referred for genetic counseling and appropriate surveillance
based on USMSTF recommendations.
88
Recommendation:
We recommend that patients who
have undergone curative resection of either colon or rectal
cancer receive their
fi
rst surveillance colonoscopy 1 year
after surgery (or 1 year after the clearing perioperative
colonoscopy).  Additional  surveillance  recommendations
apply to patients with rectal cancer (see
“
Additional
Considerations in Surveillance of Rectal Cancer
”
).
Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence
Recommendation:
We recommend that, after the 1-
year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy
should be 3 years (ie, 4 years after surgery or perioperative
colonoscopy) and then 5 years (ie, 9 years after surgery or
perioperative  colonoscopy).  Subsequent  colonoscopies
should occur at 5-year intervals until the bene
fi
tof
continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life
expectancy. If neoplastic polyps are detected, the intervals
between colonoscopies should be in accordance with pub-
lished guidelines for polyp surveillance intervals. These in-
tervals do not apply to patients with Lynch syndrome.
Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence
Additional Considerations in
Surveillance of Rectal Cancer
An important distinction is made between colon and
rectal cancer because of the latter
’
s higher propensity for
local recurrence. In the studies compiled for this review that
reported on colon and rectal cancer separately,
>
80% of
anastomotic recurrences involved patients with cancer of
the rectum or distal colon.
18,20,26,39
–
41,44,76,89
In the RCT by
Wang et al,
26
recurrent cancers diagnosed in the colon had
higher resectability than rectal malignancies. The local
recurrence rate of rectal cancer depends on accurate pre-
operative staging, neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally
advanced disease, and surgical technique. Rectal cancer
recurrence is decreased by total mesorectal excision in
which the rectum and mesorectal fascia are resected en bloc
by precise sharp dissection.
90
Excision of the rectum and
mesorectum,  via  the  low  anterior  abdominoperineal
approach, has historically been the preferred surgical
approach to low rectal cancer. Concerns about increased
mortality and morbidity and decreased quality of life post-
operatively have spurred interest in less invasive local
excision options for early rectal cancer (T1 and some T2
tumors), such as transanal excision or transanal endoscopic
microsurgery, however, these techniques are associated
with higher local recurrence rate than radical surgery.
91
–
96
Endoscopic submucosal dissection is used in some centers
as de
fi
nitive treatment of selected rectal cancers with
super
fi
cial submucosal invasion.
97
–
99
In cases where total
mesorectal excision is not performed (including transanal
excision methods), there is a rationale for periodic exami-
nation of the rectum using sigmoidoscopy or endoscopic
ultrasound. Presently, it is unclear which of these 2 mo-
dalities is better, or what the ideal surveillance intervals
should be, although EUS has the potential for detection of
extraluminal recurrence before development of intraluminal
endoscopic
fi
ndings. The use of EUS allows for sampling of
suspicious subepithelial lesions or lymph nodes and detects
recurrences at earlier stages. Some studies also report that
approximately 10% of rectal cancer recurrences are diag-
nosed by EUS only, and missed by other modalities,
including  proctoscopy.
100,101
However,  there  are  no
controlled trials evaluating whether intensive EUS improves
the survival of patients with rectal cancer. The optimal
approach to luminal surveillance in an individual patient
with resected rectal cancer requires a multidisciplinary
collaboration between gastroenterologist, colorectal sur-
geon, and oncologist. The 2006 USMSTF guidelines sug-
gested sigmoidoscopy or rectal EUS every 3 to 6 months for
the
fi
rst 2 or 3 years after surgery, in addition to colono-
scopic surveillance for metachronous neoplasms, and this
suggestion is maintained in the current document.
Recommendation:
Patients with localized rectal cancer
who have undergone surgery without total mesorectal exci-
sion, those who have undergone transanal local excision (ie,
transanal excision or transanal endoscopic microsurgery), or
endoscopic submucosal dissection, and those with locally
advanced rectal cancer who did not receive neoadjuvant
chemoradiation and then surgery using total mesorectal
excision techniques, are at increased risk for local recurrence.
In these situations, we suggest local surveillance with
fl
exible
sigmoidoscopy or EUS every 3

6 months for the
fi
rst 2

3
years after surgery. These surveillance measures are in
addition to recommended colonoscopic surveillance for
metachronous neoplasia.
Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence

CTC is a
USMSTF guideline-endorsed option for CRC screening,
102
and its role in patients with CRC is evolving. CTC is an
appropriate option in patients with obstructing CRC in
whom preoperative colonoscopy to examine the colon
proximal to the obstruction is not feasible. One large case
series included 284 patients with obstructing CRC and re-
ported sensitivity of 88.6% and negative predictive value of
97.4% for synchronous advanced neoplasia (including
advanced adenomas and cancer) proximal to the obstructing
cancer.
103
The use of CTC with intravenous contrast can be
considered preoperatively to exclude both synchronous
neoplasia and distant metastases, although caution is
advised in cases with complete colonic obstruction due to

increased perforation risk associated with gas insuf
fl
ation.
In unselected patients, CTC outperforms double-contrast
barium enema at all polyp size ranges.
104,105
A large
multicenter UK study
106
randomized 3838 patients with
symptoms suggestive of CRC to barium enema or CTC. The
detection rate of CRC or large polyps was signi
fi
cantly
higher in the CTC group (7.3% vs 5.6%; RR
¼
1.31; 95% CI:
1.01

1.68;
P
¼
.039), and CTC missed 3 of 45 CRC, while
barium enema missed 12 of 85. Thus, CTC is preferred over
barium enema for preoperative patients with obstructing
cancers; however, barium enema remains an option if local
resources and expertise do not allow CTC.
CTC has been proposed for postoperative surveillance
because it combines contrast abdominopelvic CT, which is
already part of standard post-CRC surveillance, with the
ability to detect intraluminal lesions. Thus, CTC could be a
one-step assessment for metachronous lesions, local recur-
rence, and distant metastases.
107
In the largest cohort to
date,
108
742 patients without clinical or laboratory evidence
of recurrence underwent contrast-enhanced CTC after
curative-intent CRC surgery. Six metachronous cancers and
one anastomotic recurrence were found by CTC, with sensi-
tivity of 100% for cancer and 81.8% for advanced neoplasia
(using colonoscopy with pathologic con
fi
rmation as the
reference standard). All intraluminal cancers were amenable
to additional curative treatment; an additional 11 patients
were found to have extracolonic recurrences. In patients who
have undergone CRC resection, CTC requires expertise to
differentiate normal postoperative
fi
ndings (such as in
fl
am-
matory  changes  at  the  anastomosis)  from  true  re-
currences.
109
Also, using CTC for extraluminal surveillance
requires use of intravenous contrast. Other issues are
important to consider: CTC has relatively low sensitivity for
the detection of
fl
at and diminutive (

5 mm) colonic le-
sions,
110
and sensitivity for nonadenomatous lesions (such as
sessile serrated polyps), although not well-studied, is lower
than for adenomas at comparable size thresholds.
111,112
Diminutive polyps have extremely low prevalence of
advanced histology in average-risk patients; however, this
might not apply to patients with CRC in whom even diminu-
tive lesions could be clinically signi
fi
cant. There are no lon-
gitudinal studies examining the consequences of missing or
nonreporting of diminutive
fl
at lesions and nonadenomatous
lesions in patients with CRC. In conclusion, although CTC has
gooddiagnosticaccuracyforcancer,theoptimaltimingofCTC
in post-CRC resection surveillance and how it is best used in
conjunction with other modalities remain unde
fi
ned.
109
Recommendation:
In patients with obstructive CRC
precluding complete colonoscopy, we recommend CTC as
the best alternative to exclude synchronous neoplasms.
Double-contrast barium enema is an acceptable alternative
if CTC is not available.
Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence
Fecal tests.
Older guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests
are inferior to fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) for CRC
screening.
113
Limited data exist on the role of FIT for sur-
veillance after CRC resection. One study
114
included 1736
patients with a personal or family history of colorectal
neoplasia (24% had a personal history of CRC) who had
undergone at least 2 colonoscopies and were offered an
annual FIT. The diagnosis of CRC and advanced adenomas
was made at a median of nearly 2 years earlier in patients
with a positive FIT compared with those without testing,
although it was unclear whether this applied to the sub-
group of patients with personal history of CRC. The quality
of the baseline examinations in this study was unknown;
thus, it is possible that the interval cancers were lesions
missed or incompletely resected, rather than metachronous
lesions detected by FIT.
115
Nevertheless, these data call for
additional investigation to determine the role of FIT in post-
CRC resection surveillance.
Fecal DNA testing
116
has emerged as an option for CRC
screening. Available data
117,118
suggest that DNA abnormal-
ities clear from stool after resection of colorectal neoplasms;
however, the role of fecal DNA testing in surveillance pro-
grams after CRC resection is yet to be investigated.
Recommendation:
There is insuf
fi
cient evidence to
recommend routine use of FIT or fecal DNA for surveillance
after CRC resection.
Appendix.
Summary of Recommendations
We recommend that patients with CRC undergo high-quality
perioperative clearing with colonoscopy. The procedure should be
performed preoperatively or within a 3- to 6-month interval after
surgery in the case of obstructive CRC. The goals of perioperative
clearing colonoscopy are detection of synchronous cancer and
detection and complete resection of precancerous polyps.
We recommend that patients who have undergone curative resection
of either colon or rectal cancer receive their
fi
rst surveillance
colonoscopy 1 year after surgery (or 1 year after the clearing
perioperative colonoscopy). Additional surveillance
recommendations apply to patients with rectal cancer (see
“
Additional Considerations in Surveillance of Rectal Cancer
”
).
We recommend that, after the 1-year colonoscopy, the interval to the
next colonoscopy should be 3 years (ie, 4 years after surgery or
perioperative colonoscopy), and then 5 years (ie, 9 years after
surgery or perioperative colonoscopy). Subsequent
colonoscopies should occur at 5-year intervals, until the bene
fi
tof
continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life
expectancy. If neoplastic polyps are detected, the intervals
between colonoscopies should be in accordance with the
published guidelines for polyp surveillance intervals. These
intervals do not apply to patients with Lynch syndrome.
Patients with localized rectal cancer who have undergone surgery
without total mesorectal excision, those who have undergone
transanal local excision (transanal excision or transanal endoscopic
microsurgery) or endoscopicsubmucosal dissection,and those with
locally advanced rectal cancer who did not receive neoadjuvant
chemoradiation and then surgery using total mesorectal excision
techniques are at increased risk for local recurrence. In these
situations,wesuggestlocal surveillancewith
fl
exiblesigmoidoscopy
or EUS every 3

6 months for the
fi
rst 2

3 years after surgery.
These surveillance measures are in addition to recommended
colonoscopic surveillance for metachronous neoplasia.
In patients with obstructive CRC precluding complete colonoscopy,
we recommend CTC as the best alternative to exclude
synchronous neoplasms. Double-contrast barium enema is an
acceptable alternative if CTC is not available.
There is insuf
fi
cient evidence to recommend the routine use of FIT or
fecal DNA for surveillance after CRC resection.
