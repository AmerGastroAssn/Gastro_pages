<p>
    <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.375;">Dr. Sandler received his undergraduate degree,</span>
    <em style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.375;">
        summa cum laude</em>
    <span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.375;">, from Union College in Schenectady, NY. He received his medical degree from Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, and his masters of public health from University of North Carolina
        (UNC), Chapel Hill. Dr. Sandler has committed his entire professional career to UNC, serving in growing capacities since he first joined the department of medicine as a GI fellow in 1978. He now serves as the Nina C. and John T. Sessions
        distinguished professor of medicine.</span>
</p>

<p>Dr. Sandler can be credited with giving the field of digestive disease epidemiology and outcomes an early boost. He has maintained an extraordinarily productive career over the past 30 years that has focused on research investigating the etiology
    and prevention of colon cancer; training and mentoring a generation of GI epidemiologists and academic gastroenterologists; directing the UNC&rsquo;s multidisciplinary NIDDK-funded Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease; developing a
    national clinical trials data management resource; and leading an outstanding division of gastroenterology and hepatology.</p>

<p>Dr. Sandler has worked selflessly for AGA in many capacities. In May 2015, he was appointed to the AGA Governing Board as AGA Research Foundation chair-elect, and now serves as chair. This will be Dr. Sandler&rsquo;s third term on the board;
    notably he served as president of AGA from 2008 to 2009. Before his most recent appointment to the governing board, Dr. Sandler served as chair of the AGA Publications Committee, and has previously served on the Nominating Committee (twice &mdash;
    once as chair), Audit Committee, Executive Committee, Outcomes Research Award Review Panel, Futures Committee, Research Policy Committee, Burden of Disease Task Force, Public Policy Committee, and GI Oncology Task Force. Dr. Sandler has also served
    as an associate editor of
    <em>Gastroenterology</em>.</p>
