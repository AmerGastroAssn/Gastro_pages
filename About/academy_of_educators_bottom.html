        <div class="text_content">
            <p>Accreditation from ACGME and other societies now requires integrated and active participation in interdisciplinary
                clinical quality improvement and patient safety programs. Quality improvement programs are not just buzz
                words. QI is now part of core competencies in the assessment of academic programs. How QI initiatives are
                implemented and ultimately assessed in terms of practice management changes are questions many of us struggle
                with on a near daily basis.</p>

            <h5>Appropriate prescribing of Reglan</h5>
            There are very few medications to treat gastroparesis, a not-uncommon condition that can cause significant nausea and vomiting.

            <h5>Barrett&#39;s Esophagus Surveillance</h5>
            BE surveillance is often done at intervals that are unsupported by current guidelines. We work to improve the timing of endoscopic
            surveillance procedures for patients with Barrett&#39;s esophagus to increase alignment with current guidelines

            <h5>Diarrhea: Appropriate use of antibiotics to treat C. diff/recurrent C. diff</h5>
            C. diff is a serious problem in our hospitals and communities. Some hospitals and providers may not be adhering to hospital
            and/or national (ex. ACG) guidelines on treatment of C. diff. These are generally based on factors such as the
            severity of the disease (mild, moderate, severe), the number of occurrences (primary, recurrence), and underlying
            factors (such as IBD). Inappropriate antibiotic selection may result in ineffective treatment of C. diff (including
            delayed referral for fecal microbiota transplant when appropriate) and expose patients to unnecessary antibiotics.

            <ul>
                <li>Variceal bleeding is an important cause of patient morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients.</li>
                <li>It is important to know the risks of first variceal bleeding, treatment of variceal bleeding, and prevention
                    of variceal rebleeding.</li>
                <li>Clinicians must understand the importance of low and high risk varices and the importance of medical managment
                    of these patients.</li>
                <li>We must mobilize resources to get patients referred and adequately screened for varices.</li>
