        <h2>What is MACRA?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="long">
        <p>MACRA legislation was created to repeal the longstanding sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula, which threatened ongoing untenable cuts to physician payment. As part of the SGR repeal, Congress mandated that CMS undertake a major overhaul of
            existing payment and quality programs.</p>

        <p>There is a five-year transition period to a more quality- and value-based Medicare program during which CMS provides stable payment updates to physicians. Once fully implemented, MACRA will absorb existing programs, such as EHR Incentive Program
            and meaningful use requirements, the Value-based Payment Modifier, and PQRS.

        <h2>What is the Quality Payment Program?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="long">
        <p>CMS recently released proposed rules implementing its new Quality Payment Program (QPP), which was created after Congress passed the MACRA legislation. The QPP provides physicians with the choice to participate in either the new Merit-based
            Incentive Payment Systems (MIPS) or, as an alternative to MIPS, advanced alternative payment models (APMs).
