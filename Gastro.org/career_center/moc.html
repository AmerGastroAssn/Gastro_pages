<h2>AGA&#39;s Principles for MOC Reform</h2>

<ul>
    <li>We support ending the high-stakes, every 10-year exam.</li>
    <li>We do not support closed-book assessments as they do not represent the current realities of medicine in the digital age.</li>
    <li>We support the principles of lifelong learning as evidenced by ongoing CME activities, rather than lifelong testing.</li>
    <li>We support the concept that, for the many diplomates who specialize in certain areas of gastroenterology and hepatology,
        MOC should not need to include high-stakes assessments of areas where the diplomate may not practice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>AGA Continues to Push ABIM to Reform MOC</h2>

<p>AGA continues to work with ABIM and other specialty societies to improve the recertification process.&nbsp;Here is a summary
    of recent events.</p>

<p><strong>Sept. 2016:&nbsp;</strong>ABIM distributed a survey&nbsp;to all board-certified physicians outlining two proposed
    alternative&nbsp;MOC&nbsp;assessment pathways&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;a two-year and five-year model&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;currently
    under consideration by ABIM. <a href="/news_items/abim-launches-survey-aga-continues-to-advocate-for-moc-reform" target="_top">AGA has concerns about these pathways</a>,
    which fall short of our principles of individualization, lifelong education and low-stakes testing.&nbsp;AGA will meet
    with&nbsp;other internal medicine societies (including cardiologists, oncologists, hematologists, rheumatologists, nephrologists
    and endocrinologists) to share our views with ABIM.</p>

<p><strong>May 2016:&nbsp;</strong><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">ABIM responded to the April&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.gastro.org/Letter_to_ABIM_April2016.pdf"
        style="line-height: 20.8px;" target="_top">letter</a><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;sent by an AGA-led coalition of internal medicine societies, asking for clarity about ABIM&rsquo;s vision for the MOC process.&nbsp;</span>
    <span
        style="line-height: 20.8px;">The board committed to providing specialty societies with advance notice of any potential changes in the process, agreeing
        to consider our insights when developing those changes. Significantly, ABIM also noted that it expects to provide
        more specific details about what the alternative option will look like no later than <a href="http://www.gastro.org/news_items/2016/5/17/abim-responds-to-aga-call-for-moc-plan"
            target="_top">Dec. 31, 2016</a>.</span>
</p>

<p><strong>May 2016:&nbsp;</strong>ABIM <a href="http://www.abim.org/news/abim-announces-plans-to-offer-physicians-moc-assessment-options-in-january-2018.aspx"
        target="_top">announced plans</a> to offer physicians the option of taking shorter assessments on their personal or office
    computer more frequently than every 10 years but no more than annually. This is a step in the right direction, but questions
    remain as to whether the changes are enough or whether the assessment will be individualized to the professional activities
    of subspecialists. Our work continues.</p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 20.8px;">April 2016:&nbsp;</strong><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">AGA&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.gastro.org/Letter_to_ABIM_April2016.pdf"
        style="line-height: 20.8px;" target="_top">sent a letter to ABIM</a><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;seeking to understand its plan for re-engineering MOC to reflect the changing nature of medical practice. Presidents of AGA and leading specialty societies posed a number of questions and asked for answer by the end of April. We will keep you posted on what we hear.</span></p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 20.8px;">March 2016: &nbsp;</strong><a href="/news_items/2016/3/24/after-months-of-aga-advocacy-some-progress-from-abim"

        target="_top">ABIM launched a study</a><span style="box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(44, 41, 46); font-family: Roboto, Oswald, sans-serif; line-height: 1.375;">&nbsp;to examine ways ABIM diplomates might have access to online resources during a portion of the MOC assessment. In this update, ABIM leaders promised to develop a timetable and plan to reform MOC, based on what they have heard from the physician community.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 20.8px;"><strong>March 2016:&nbsp;</strong><a href="/news_items/2016/3/9/report-from-the-abim-gi-specialty-board-meeting" target="_top">AGA attended the usually closed-door American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) GI Specialty Board meeting</a>.
    Although we are viewing the invitation to attend this meeting as a positive step, it seems that ABIM has no definitive
    approach to change the high-stakes examination and that their current efforts were focused on maintaining business as
    usual.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 20.8px;">November 2015:&nbsp;</strong><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">In November 2015, AGA Institute President Michael Camilleri, MD, AGAF, and other AGA leaders met with ABIM to share feedback and a <a href="http://www.gastro.org/Nov15_ABIM_letter_from_GI_Societies.pdf" target="_top">joint letter</a>. During this meeting, Dr. Camilleri emphasized that gastroenterologists need a recertification system that fosters active learning, not high-stakes testing.</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;"><strong>September 2015:</strong>&nbsp;In September, ABIM released&nbsp;</span><a href="http://assessment2020.abim.org/final-report/"
        style="line-height: 1.6;" target="_top"><em>Assessment 2020, A Vision for Certification in Internal Medicine in 2020</em></a>

<p><strong>August 2015:</strong> AGA issued an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gastro.org/news_items/2015/8/20/aga-proposes-eliminating-secure-exam-for-moc"
        target="_top">alternate pathway proposal</a>, which&nbsp;eliminates the high-stakes examination and replaces it with
    active and adaptive learning self-directed modules that allow for continuous feedback, and are based solidly on learning
    theory. Some highlights include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Replace the 10-year Maintenance of Certification Exam with More Frequent, Less Burdensome Exams</li>
    <li>Recommendation: Focus Assessments on Cognitive and Technical Skills.</li>
    <li>Recognize Specialization</li>

<h2>ABIM Task Force Recommends Eliminating 10-Year Exam</h2>

<p>In September, ABIM released&nbsp;<a href="http://assessment2020.abim.org/final-report/" target="_top"><em>Assessment 2020, A Vision for Certification in Internal Medicine in 2020</em></a>, a report from an ABIM-convened task force.&nbsp;Many of the recommendations are consistent with those in <a href="http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(15)01177-4/pdf" target="_top">AGA&rsquo;s proposed pathway</a>.&nbsp;However, AGA is very eager to ensure recertification reform before 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.375;">AGA&nbsp;</span><a href="/news_items/2015/9/16/abim-task-force-recommends-eliminating-10-year-exam" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.375;" target="_top">provided comments</a><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.375;"> on three of the key recommendations that the ABIM task force provided. The ABIM task force&#39;s recommendations include:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Replace the 10-year Maintenance of Certification Exam with More Frequent, Less Burdensome Exams</li>
	<li>Recommendation: Focus Assessments on Cognitive and Technical Skills.</li>
	<li>Recognize Specialization</li>
</ul>

<h2>AGA Proposes Alternate Pathway to Recertification</h2>

<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Three things to know about AGA&rsquo;s alternate pathway,&nbsp;The Gastroenterologist: Accountable Professionalism in Practice or G-APP:</p>

<ul style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">
	<li>Individual self-assessment pathways allow physicians to achieve a high level of competency in one or more areas, while maintaining a general level of competency in other areas.</li>
	<li>Individualized self-assessment activities provide constant feedback and opportunities for learning and replace the high-stakes exam now required every 10 years.</li>
	<li>Physicians get credit for activities they are already doing in practice, research or teaching.</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">G-APP is based on principles of competency that are the same as those used to train gastroenterology fellows to independently care for patients.</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Read the full proposal, released in August 2015, in&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(15)01177-4/pdf" target="_top">Gastroenterology</a></em>&nbsp;or <em><a href="http://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(15)01121-0/pdf" target="_top">Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</a></em>,&nbsp;and the editorial, <a href="http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(15)01178-6/pdf" target="_top">An Alternative to MOC?</a>.</p>
