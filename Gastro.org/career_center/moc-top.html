<h2>AGA&#39;s Principles for MOC Reform</h2>

<ul>
	<li>We support ending the high-stakes, every 10-year exam.</li>
	<li>We do not support closed-book assessments as they do not represent the current realities of medicine in the digital age.</li>
	<li>We support the principles of lifelong learning as evidenced by ongoing CME activities, rather than lifelong testing.</li>
	<li>We support the concept that, for the many diplomates who specialize in certain areas of gastroenterology and hepatology, MOC should not need to include high-stakes assessments of areas where the diplomate may not practice.</li>
</ul>
