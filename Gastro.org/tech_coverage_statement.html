<p>The Coverage and Reimbursement Subcommittee (CRS) of the AGA Practice Management and Economics Committee (PMEC) takes an active role in ensuring payor coverage and reimbursement for proven procedures, diagnostics and therapies that advance the science and practice of gastroenterology. In this era of value-based care, it is important for gastroenterologists to have access to and coverage for technologies and therapeutics that can improve care for the patients you treat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Technologies meeting the following criteria are considered for development of Technology Coverage Statements.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>All devices and drugs necessary for performance of the procedure or service have received FDA clearance or approval when such is required for performance of the procedure or service, or is a laboratory-developed test (LDT) which is designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory and meets the general regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA). &nbsp;</li>
	<li>The procedure or service is consistent with current medical practice.</li>
	<li>The clinical efficacy of the procedure, therapeutic, diagnostic or service is documented in peer reviewed literature, which is available in English.</li>
	<li>Published clinical evidence meeting at least one of the following criteria:
	<ul>
		<li>Evidence obtained from meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</li>
		<li>Evidence obtained from at least one randomized controlled trial with at least three-year follow-up data.</li>
		<li>Evidence obtained from at least one non-randomized trial with multi-year follow-up data demonstrating an improvement in health outcomes.</li>
		<li>Evidence obtained from at least one non-randomized trial demonstrating how the diagnostic service leads to a change in management compared to the standard of care.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
