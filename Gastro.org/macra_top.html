                <p>Many things about the <a href="/news_items/new-administration-will-bring-changes-aga-wants-patients-protected"
                        target="_top">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA; Obamacare) are likely to change under the new administration,
                    but MACRA and the commitment to cost-effective, value-based care is here to stay. <a href="/news_items/macra-is-not-going-away-will-you-be-ready"
                        target="_top">MACRA is separate from the ACA</a>. Congress overwhelmingly passed MACRA legislation with
                    bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress. MACRA will eventually transition physicians toward more
                    value-based payments.</p>

                <p>It is important to understand MACRA to ensure you are doing everything required under the current rules in
                    2017. Ignore MACRA in 2017 and you will face an automatic reduction of 4 percent to your payments under
                    Medicare in 2019.</p>
