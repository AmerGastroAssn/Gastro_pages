                review met face-to-face on May 20, 2016, to discuss the quality of evidence (<a class="figureLink" href="#tbl1" id="back-tbl1">Table&nbsp;1</a>) and consider other factors relevant for the risk-benefit assessment of the recommendations.
                The guideline authors subsequently formulated the recommendations. Although quality of evidence was a key factor in determining the strength of each recommendation (
                <a class="figureLink" href="#tbl2" id="back-tbl2">Table&nbsp;2</a>), the panel also considered the balance between the benefit and harm of interventions, patients&rsquo; values and preferences, and resource utilization.</p>

                                <p><em>Comments: In a setting of high clinical suspicion, testing for Wilson&rsquo;s disease can be considered, keeping in mind the low positive predictive value. Although the management and outcome of acute liver failure (ALF) would not be altered, identification of Wilson&rsquo;s disease would allow appropriate post-transplantation management and screening of the patient&rsquo;s family members.</em></p>

                                <p>Common diagnostic testing for Wilson&rsquo;s disease includes serum ceruloplasmin, serum and hepatic copper assessment, and 24-hour urine collection for copper. The tests have high false-positive and false-negative rates,
                                    and no large studies have been performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of testing specifically for Wilson&rsquo;s disease in ALF. Three case&ndash;control studies involving both children and adults reported on a
                                    total of 37 Wilson&rsquo;s disease subjects and 322 controls with ALF from other causes. One study suggested that the sensitivity of serum copper greater than 200 ug/dL was 75% and specificity was 96%. The other studies
                                    noted that urinary copper was increased in all cases, but no sensitivity and specificity were reported.</p>

                                <p>Because Wilson&rsquo;s disease has a very low prevalence in the ALF population, there is a great likelihood that any test for Wilson&rsquo;s disease would have a high negative predictive value but a low positive predictive
                                    value. Furthermore, the diagnosis is unlikely to alter the management of ALF caused by Wilson&rsquo;s disease because liver transplantation is the ultimate outcome.</p>

                                <p>Common diagnostic testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection includes HSV serologies and HSV DNA. HSV is a rare cause of ALF. Four case series were evaluated including 513 adult patients with ALF and 1% had positive
                                    HSV serologies. Consequently, there have been little data regarding the diagnostic accuracy or treatment of HSV in the setting of ALF. Regarding diagnostic testing, 1 case series with 4 patients with ALF caused by HSV
                                    confirmed by liver biopsy/autopsy showed that 2 of 4 patients had positive HSV IgM and all 4 patients had positive HSV DNA.</p>

                                <p>Regarding treatment, HSV in ALF has a poor prognosis even with acyclovir therapy. However, there is a suggestion on a case-report level that patients with acute hepatitis secondary to HSV do better with treatment than without.
                                    There is little downside to treatment with acyclovir from cost or adverse event standpoints.</p>

                                <p>There were only 10 case reports of patients with ALF attributed to varicella zoster virus (VZV). Only 2 case reports involved patients who were not immunocompromised. No evaluable data were available on diagnostic testing
                                    or treatment of VZV, particularly in the immunocompetent setting.</p>

                                <p>Acute hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is common in endemic parts of the world, although it is uncommon elsewhere. In endemic areas, acute liver failure attributed to HEV has been observed. It is particularly common in
                                    pregnant women, and has a significant mortality in this population. Five studies from India assessed mortality in ALF secondary to HEV in pregnant women. An overall rate of 56% (range, 33%&ndash;71%) was observed. There
                                    is no treatment for HEV.</p>

                                <p>Liver transplantation for patients with ALF is a life-saving procedure, yet itself has significant morbidity and mortality. It is expensive and patients require life-long immunosuppression. Some patients with ALF recover
                                    without the need for liver transplantation, whereas others derive benefit. Prognostic systems to help predict who will and will not require liver transplantation have arisen. The 2&nbsp;that have been best-studied are
                                    the Kings College Criteria (KCC) and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score.</p>

                                <p><em>Comment: A MELD score of 30.5 (fixed cut-off value) should be used for prognosis. Higher scores predict a need for liver transplantation.</em></p>

                                <p>The KCC has been evaluated in 8 studies involving 962 patients with ALF, of whom 47% died. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for predicting mortality was 61% (range, 47%&ndash;76%) and 86% (range, 64%&ndash;95%), respectively
                                    (diagnostic odds ratio, 9.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.74&ndash;19.36). The MELD score has been evaluated in 6 studies involving 526 ALF patients, of whom 58% died. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for
                                    predicting mortality was 77% (range, 70%&ndash;92%) and 72% (range, 56%&ndash;85%), respectively (diagnostic odds ratio, 8.79; 95% CI, 5.19&ndash;14.89).</p>

                                <p>Regarding KCC vs MELD score, KCC is more specific and MELD is more sensitive. The MELD score offers the opportunity to optimize specificity without losing significant sensitivity, and thus is optimal.</p>

                                <p>Liver biopsy is a procedure that has an uncertain role in ALF. Liver biopsy could add diagnostic information that is helpful and could provide prognostic information that helps with the decision to proceed with liver transplantation.
                                    Alternatively, liver biopsy has risks of bleeding and death that are not insignificant in patients with ALF and coagulopathy.</p>

                                <p>Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an uncommon cause of ALF, although the exact number of afflicted patients is unclear. Quality data regarding diagnostic testing and response to corticosteroid therapy for ALF secondary to AIH

                                <p>One study indicated that 93% of patients with AIH by previously defined diagnostic criteria had positive autoantibodies. In addition, AIH patients who received corticosteroids had a better outcome than did patients with
                                    indeterminate AIH.</p>

                                <p>Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in ALF is associated with increased mortality. It is unclear if or when monitoring of ICP is indicated, or whether decreasing ICP decreases mortality and, if so, which method of reducing
                                    ICP is best. It should be noted that monitoring ICP has morbidity. If therapy is ineffective, monitoring in the first place would be inadvisable. Furthermore, the approaches to reducing ICP also have associated risk,

                                <p>Extracorporeal liver support systems for patients with ALF are potentially useful to allow time for spontaneous recovery and avoid liver transplantation. Support systems also may be life-sustaining to allow more time to

                                <p>Three systematic reviews have assessed artificial liver support systems for ALF and all reported no clear effect on mortality. Seven RCTs have been performed in patients with ALF involving 415 patients. No improvement in
                                    survival was observed. However, in 4 trials performed within the past 20 years involving 332 patients with ALF, there was a marginally significant survival benefit. Adverse events were reported in 6 trials. No difference
                                    between the intervention groups and usual care was noted.</p>

                                    was a trend to decreased mortality.</p>

                                <p>Four RCTs assessed albumin dialysis vs usual care in 340 patients with ALF. No significant decrease in mortality was identified, although a trend to decreased mortality was noted. Four RCTs evaluated traditional extracorporeal
                                    liver support systems; no decrease in mortality was identified. In a post hoc analysis, combination of albumin and bioartificial liver support systems resulted in decreased mortality (relative risk, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65&ndash;0.98).</p>

                                <p>When evaluating all of the data, there may be benefit to liver support systems in ALF, although the data are not robust enough to render a recommendation. Notably, the support systems also have significant potential toxicities,

            <div class="content">
                <p>ALF is a rare but significant clinical problem with high morbidity and mortality. It is an uncommon disease process characterized by rapid progression and death. Liver transplantation, the ultimate treatment strategy, is necessary for
                    some patients and requires significant resources and a lifetime of immunosuppression, yet other patients have had spontaneous resolution and no long-term issues.</p>

                <p>Because ALF has been difficult to study in RCTs, there are many areas of controversy regarding diagnosis, predictive models for outcome, and management. By using the GRADE framework, this guideline offers recommendations about controversial

                <p>However, there are data to support a strong recommendation for the use of NAC in patients with ALF related to acetaminophen. There remains a lack of data to allow recommendations for testing for Wilson&rsquo;s disease and VZV in patients
                    with ALF. Although there are low-quality data, because there are therapies that may be beneficial in patients with ALF, recommendations to test for HSV and AIH are supported. HEV testing is recommended in pregnant women with ALF. Data
                    do not support recommending routine use of diagnostic liver biopsy or empiric therapy of high ICP in patients with ALF. As a predictive model, MELD score with a fixed cut-off value of 30.5 is recommended. In other cases, data are suggestive
                    of a possible benefit of therapeutic strategies in certain cases but not robust enough without additional study to make a recommendation such as NAC in patients with non&ndash;acetaminophen-related ALF or use of extracorporeal liver
                    support systems in ALF.</p>

                <p>Recognizing these and other limitations, the recommendations included here represent a rigorous, evidence-based summary of extensive literature describing the diagnosis and treatment of ALF and use of predictive models. Review of this
                    guideline, plus the associated technical review, will facilitate effective shared decision making with ALF patients.</p>
