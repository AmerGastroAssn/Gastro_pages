        <p>How to Join a Section</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text_content">
        <p>The council is divided into 13 sections that represent special interest groups among AGA members. AGA invites all members to join up to six sections. By joining a section, AGA members will benefit from networking opportunities, professional
            recognition and growth, and involvement in the council&rsquo;s educational programming at DDW and throughout the year. To join or manage your section affiliations, email
            <a href="mailto:agacouncil@gastro.org" target="_top">agacouncil@gastro.org</a>
            or visit
            <a href="/my-aga" target="_top">My AGA</a>. Review your section&rsquo;s page for ideas on how you can get involved.</p>

                </strong>Maria T. Abreu, MD, AGAF</a>

            <p>&ldquo;I am honored and excited to have been chosen as the next AGA council chair. My goal will be to make the time spent by our AGA members at DDW the most impactful for their professions as clinicians and researchers. We will work as a group to
                reduce redundancy and make the program the most important single meeting members attend every year.&rdquo;</p>
