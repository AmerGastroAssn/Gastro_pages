<p>Over the last decade several promising GI technologies have failed, in part, due to lack of guidance and support by the field.
    AGA recognizes that innovation and the development of new technology are integral to advancing the science and practice
    of gastroenterology and improving patient care and health outcomes for digestive diseases. AGA has established the AGA
    Center for GI Innovation and Technology to support the development of technology that can improve patient care under
    the guidance of evidence-based standards. The center will serve as an objective GI-specific resource to assist members,
    GI researchers, entrepreneurs and the medical device, therapeutics and investment communities in their work to bring
    new technology to the marketplace.</p>

<p>Through the center, AGA will work with key regulatory bodies and the commercial payor community to better understand their
    specific requirements for coverage, adoption and reimbursement and, in turn, will translate that information to the field.&nbsp;
    <span
        style="line-height: 1.6;">Through the center, AGA will advocate for a transparent and fair process that does not stifle innovation. </span>
</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">By working collaboratively with our members, regulators and the medical device, therapeutics and investment communities to address the collective issues, AGA will support a healthy pipeline of evidence-based advancements in digestive disorders and the research, education, training and advocacy for gastroenterology to improve patient care.</span></p>

<h2>Focused Activities</h2>

<p>The center does not endorse any product or service. It is not an explicit industry advocate. AGA cannot guarantee that any
    product or service will be approved by FDA, and/or is adopted or will obtain coding, coverage, and/or reimbursement from
    governmental and private payors.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Resource" name="Resource" target="_top"></a>Objective Resource</strong></h3>

<p>Provide feedback and guidance related to whether there is a need to develop a new technology or device in a given area. AGA
    can also offer guidance on payor requirements, billing, and steps needed to obtain coverage and reimbursement.</p>

<h3>
    <b><a id="Literature" name="Literature" target="_top">Assessment of Peer-Reviewed Literature</a></b>
</h3>

<p>AGA can assess literature for level of evidence, gaps and regulatory requirements (CMS, CTAF, private payors, etc.). AGA
    can also provide recommendations on additional studies and/or publications and development of training standards.</p>

<h3>
    <a id="Experts" name="Experts" target="_top"></a>Identification of Experts</h3>

<p>AGA can identify clinical investigators and provide expert reviews and assessments of peer-reviewed literature.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>Provide members, clinical investigators, medical device companies and investors with information to help them understand
    the requirements of private payors and policy makers, such as FDA, CMS and AHRQ.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">AGA can help support a companies need to obtain and gather data and evidence required by physician members, payors and regulatory
    agencies. <a href="/about/initiatives/aga-center-for-gi-innovation-and-technology/observational-research-device-registries"

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>Develop evidence-based training standards for new technologies and mechanisms for training.</p>

<h3>Advocacy</h3>

<p>Support and promote the development of equitable policies and payment for&nbsp;proven technologies.</p>

<h3><strong>Research</strong></h3>

<p>Promote evidence-based and outcomes driven research for new technologies.</p>

<h3>White Papers</h3>

<p>Commission the development of white papers addressing issues and/or plans of action for medical device development in gastroenterology.</p>

<h2>
    <a id="Committees" name="Committees" target="_top"></a>Executive Committee and Strategic Advisory Board</h2>

<p>The executive committee serves as the governing body that oversees all operations of the center; including the successful
    implementation, monitoring and ongoing management of resources and activities related to the center. Three subcommittees
    report to the executive committee and support the work of the center.</p>
