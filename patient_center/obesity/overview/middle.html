<h3 class="bar">Practice Resources</h3>

<p>The POWER (Practice guide on Obesity and Weight management, Education and Resources) white paper was developed in collaboration with the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), The Obesity Society (TOS), the Academy of Nutrition
    and Dietetics (AND), and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN). The objective of POWER is to provide physicians with a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary process to guide and personalize innovative
    obesity care for safe and effective weight management.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of a linear care pathway, the POWER program care cycle is circular in order to represent the fact that obesity is a chronic disease that requires a lifelong multidisciplinary approach for effective, long-term therapy. Each portion of the circle
    represents a different step in the continued, comprehensive approach to obesity treatment. To view a high-resolution version of the care cycle, click the thumbnail below</p>

            <p>The AGA Obesity Episode of Care Bundle white paper was developed in collaboration with the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), the American Psychological Association (APA),
                the American Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (AIPS), gastroenterologists providing obesity management services in the academic, community, small and large group, and single and multispecialty settings, a hospital administrator, and
                health information reform experts from the Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute (HCI3) and RAND, and payer and coding representatives. The Obesity Episode of Care Bundle encompasses non-surgical and endoscopic management of obesity
                and incorporates coding recommendations for services not routinely encountered by gastroenterologists. It includes a hybrid episode payment model that identified those services eligible under the Affordable Care Act / insurance versus
                those paid out-of-pocket.</p>
