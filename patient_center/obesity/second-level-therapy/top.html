<p>After an intense weight loss intervention phase, the POWER program recommends achieving continued weight loss through sustained dietary, physical activity, and behavioral changes. Second-level therapies should be added to Cornerstone Therapy if patients have not achieved weight loss goals, or at the outset of treatment if they have a history or circumstances that warrant more rapid weight loss. Pharmacologic, endoscopic, and/or surgical bariatric therapies should be considered and can be used in combination or sequentially. Below, find helpful resources including education materials explaining the different treatment options, lists of FDA-approved therapies, and recommendations for their use.</p>
