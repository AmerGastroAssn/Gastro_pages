        <p>Each of the programs listed receive numerous requests from individuals looking for clinical or research opportunities. However, programs listed are affiliated with members of the AGA International Committee who are eager to host AGA&rsquo;s
            international members. We recommend that you clearly define your goals for the program prior to submitting an application. You may also want to indicate qualities that make you stand out above other applicants (prior research experience, career
            achievements, board scores, etc). It may also be helpful to research the institution and its faculty by visiting the institution&rsquo;s website so that you can clearly articulate how your goals for your clinical/research experience align with the
            interests and mission of the program.</p>
