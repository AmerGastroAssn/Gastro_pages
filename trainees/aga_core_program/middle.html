            />Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas is home to more than 20 medical specialty centers, many of which
            are ranked among the top 50 hospitals in the country. Baylor Dallas offers four distinctive opportunities for
            gastrointestinal clinical observerships and research opportunities: At the Baylor IBD Center, clinical trainees
            gain confidence in managing IBD and have the opportunity to co-author an original paper while shadowing Dr. Themistocles
            Dassopoulos. Research trainees at the Center for Gastrointestinal Cancer Research and the Center for Epigenetics,
            Cancer Prevention and Cancer Genomics will be mentored by Ajay Goel, Ph.D., while working on various basic and
            translational aspects of gastrointestinal cancers. In the Mucosal Pathobiology Lab, research trainees will work
            with Arianne Theiss, Ph.D., performing basic science/translational research experiments utilizing human intestinal
            mucosal biopsies, novel mouse models of spontaneous ileitis, intestinal organoids, and cultured epithelial cells.
            Research trainees at Baylor Institute for Immunology Research will work under Venuprasad K. Poojary, Ph.D., on
            highly sophisticated cell, molecular biological and immunological approaches.</p>

            />Established in 1920, Virginia Mason began as an 80-bed hospital with six physician offices. Today, Virginia
            Mason Medical Center is recognized as one of the nation&#39;s best health care facilities encompassing 7 centers
            of excellence including IBD, hepatology, nutrition, bariatric treatment, endoscopy, pancreas and biliary disease
            and esophagus. Virginia Mason has strong ties with its affiliated Benaroya Research Institute, a leading center
            in immunology research and the current seat for the Immune Tolerance Network program. The Virginia Mason Medical
            Center offers both clinical observerships and research opportunities to potential trainees. Clinical observerships
            include shadowing all three members of the IBD group as they provide clinical services and perform procedures.
            The estimated length of the observership is five days per week for two months. Research opportunities include
            working with two clinical investigators with experience in clinical outcomes research and clinical trials, and/or
            one translational T-cell immunologist who is involved in basic science, translational work, and clinical trials.
            The estimated length of the research opportunity is nine months.</p>

            in medical education. The multidisciplinary IBD Center at Carilion Clinic, directed by Dr. Dario Sorrentino,
            is committed to conducting groundbreaking research in IBD while offering the highest standard of care. Opportunities
            for international visitors include several clinical IBD focused research projects (1 year) as well as clinical
            observerships (1 to 3 months) of tertiary level IBD clinic and IBD endoscopy. IBD surgery, led by Dr. Sandy Fogel,
            is a busy service with up to 50-80 procedures performed each year making the Center one of the leaders in the
            U.S. Procedures performed include: resections, stricturoplasties, diversions, colostomies, Ileostomies, pouch
            procedures (including J pouch), restorative procto-colectomies, revision/repair of continent ileostomies, fistula
            resections, open drainage of abscesses. One to three months observerships in IBD surgery are available to international
            visitors. The Advanced Endoscopy Center, directed by Dr. Paul Yeaton, specializes in pancreatobiliary endoscopy
            focusing on complex diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including EUS, EMR, ERCP, and many others. One to three
            months observerships in pancreatobiliary endoscopy are available to international visitors. Basic research projects
            are tutored by Dr Irving C. Allen at the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg and include evaluating novel infammatory
            signaling in IBD; developing human intestinal organoids to evaluate host-microbiome interactions and utilizing
            genetically engineered pigs to model NLR infammasome function in IBD.</p>

            education and advanced health care. Potential trainees may participate in clinical observerships or research
            opportunities. Clinical observerships include shadowing Dr. Deborah Proctor in mostly IBD outpatient clinics;
            however, some inpatient hospital experience is also available. The length of the clinical observership would
            be four to eight weeks. Research opportunities include research experience with Dr. Fred Gorelick whose laboratory
            focuses on basic science research on the pancreas and enzyme activation. Trainees would learn about the basic
            techniques that are used in Dr. Gorelick&rsquo;s lab. The length of time would preferably be 6-12 months, but
            trainees could participate for a minimum of 3 months.</p>
