            <b>Clinical Observership</b>: The purpose of this program is to attract young doctors/trainees into the US by providing basic research opportunities (1 or 2 years) and clinical observerships (1 to 3 months) with Virginia Tech and Carilion Clinic.
            Opportunities will include but are not limited to immunology focused research projects and several clinical opportunities including observation of complex endoscopic procedures, IBD clinic and endoscopy and minimally invasive IBD surgery, IBD
            clinical trials and investigator initiated studies. Participants will be self-funded unless grant money is available. All participants whether they will be working on the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, VA or at Carilion Clinic in Roanoke, VA
            will contact Wendy O’Rourke, Program Manager for details on how to apply to either track. Ms. O’Rourke will facilitate the communication and process with the Virginia Tech Office of International Affairs (VTOIA).

            <b>Clinical Observership</b>: Themistocles Dassopoulos, M.D., Director, Baylor IBD Center The Baylor IBD center is the premier tertiary IBD Center in North Texas and adjacent regions of Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. The mission of the center is
            to provide care to patients with complicated IBD, educate patients and physicians, and perform cutting edge clinical and translational research. The trainee will be mentored by Dr. Dassopoulos, a nationally recognized IBD clinician and clinical
            researcher. The trainee will observe Dr. Dassopoulos in the clinic, hospital rounds and endoscopic procedures, read a body of core IBD literature and participate in the teaching conferences of the GI division. The trainee will have the opportunity to
            be involved in clinical research that does not involve patient care, including systematic reviews/meta-analyses, cost-effectiveness analyses, and analyses of large datasets. The duration of the preceptorship will be 1 to 6 months. Dr. Dassopoulos
            will allocate one hour daily on one-to-one interaction with the trainee. The trainee will be expected to 1) gain confidence in managing IBD and 2) (ideally) co-author an original paper. No funds are available.</p>

            <b>Research:</b> <b><i>Ajay Goel, Ph.D., Director, Center for Gastrointestinal Research; Director, Center for Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Cancer Genomics</i></b> The Center for Gastrointestinal Cancer Research and the Center for Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Cancer Genomics at the Baylor Scott & White Research Institute, have a broad research focus on understanding the molecular pathogenesis of human
            gastrointestinal cancers as it relates to cancer prevention. The major objective of our research involves deciphering the interplay between genetic and epigenetic alterations in sporadic and familial (e.g. Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous
            polyposis, serrated polyposis) forms of colorectal cancer and other gastrointestinal cancers (gastric, pancreatic and hepatocellular). The broad mission of the research program is to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct high quality research into the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal cancers</li>
            <li>Develop clinically useful biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal polyps and cancer</li>
            <li>Develop clinically useful biomarkers that can help direct therapeutic treatments for patients with colorectal cancer</li>
            <li>Develop diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease</li>
            <li>Develop complementary and alternative approaches using diet-based natural compounds for the prevention of gastrointestinal cancers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The trainee will be mentored by the Center Director, and will work closely with the post-doctoral fellows, senior scientists and other visiting researchers on various basic and translational aspects of gastrointestinal cancers. We would expect a
            minimum of 6 months and up to 2-3 years of time. Funds are available for trained fellows but not trainees.

            <b><i>Arianne Theiss, Ph.D., Associate Investigator, Baylor Research Institute</i></b>
            <br>
            The Mucosal Pathobiology Lab at Baylor Scott & White Research Institute aims to better understand the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and to develop novel treatment strategies for patients with IBD. Toward this aim, Dr. Theiss
            investigates the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated cancer and the efficacy of novel mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics to combat intestinal inflammation. More specifically, her
            studies have focused on 1) the interplay of mitochondrial function with Paneth cell autophagy in Crohn’s ileitis and 2) altered mitochondrial metabolism as a driver of the progression from colitis to cancer. The trainee will work with Arianne L.
            Theiss and members of the Theiss lab performing basic science/translational experiments utilizing human intestinal mucosal biopsies, novel mouse models of spontaneous ileitis, intestinal organoids, and cultured epithelial cells. The estimated time
            devoted to the research experience is a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 3 years. Funds are available.</p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Venuprasad K. Poojary, Ph.D., Associate Investigator, Baylor Institute for Immunology Research</i></b>
            <br>
            The Baylor Institute for Immunology Research (BIIR) at the Baylor Scott & White Research Institute is one of leading centers for immunology and inflammation research. BIIR has a broad focus on understanding the dysregulated pathways in the immune
            system that lead to inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). The major objective of our research is to decipher the key signaling pathways in the immune cells that inhibit gastrointestinal inflammation. Specifically, we
            focus on the post-translational modifications that operate in the inflammatory cells to attenuate inflammation. Our goal is to discover novel targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>
        <p>The trainee will be mentored by Dr. Venuprasad Poojary (PI), and will work closely with the post-doctoral fellows and the graduate students in the lab. Out research involves highly sophisticated cell and molecular biological and immunological
            approaches. Hands-on training will be provided to the trainees. We would expect a minimum of 6 months and up to 3-4 years of time. Funds are available."</p>
