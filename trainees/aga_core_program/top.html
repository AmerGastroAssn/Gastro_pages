<p>The AGA Clinical Observation and Research Education (CORE) Program has been developed as a response to our international gastroenterology and hepatology colleagues who have expressed an interest in participating in clinical and/or research
    opportunities in the U.S. AGA has taken a leadership role in this matching process and will make available the necessary information so that interested members can be paired with mentors and institutions who can provide the desired experience,
    whether is it clinical or research.<br/>
    &nbsp;<br/>
    The program does not provide funding, but serves as a channel to facilitate connections between interested members and institutions. Applicants and/or institutions are required to have adequate funding to cover their expenses. Arrangements including
    logistics and specific requirements might change from place to place.<br/>
