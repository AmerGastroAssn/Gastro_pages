                <p>Well-established GI practice, with a superb reputation in the Northwest suburbs of Houston, Texas, is currently seeking to further enhance our already highly acclaimed group of physicians. Our esteemed group has been providing outstanding gastrointestinal and liver care for patients in the North Houston, Humble/Kingwood and Atascocita areas for the past 28 years.&nbsp;<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    The team approach with our group and its university trained physicians, skilled medical assistants and quality nursing staff makes each patient&#39;s experience further unique and memorable. Furthermore, we are one of the only groups north of the Texas Medical Center (the largest medical center in the world) that utilizes specialty ancillary services and offers in-house procedures and services such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Onsite Ultrasound Studies</li>
                    <li>Onsite Capsule Endoscopy and Smart Pill Endoscopy</li>
                    <li>Onsite Esophageal Manometry and PH Monitoring Studies</li>
                    <li>Onsite Anorectal Manometry Studies</li>
                    <li>Onsite Hydrogen and Urea Breath Test Studies&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Onsite Hemorrhoid Banding&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Onsite Fecal Incontinence Injections (Solesta Treatments)</li>
                    <li>Onsite Remicaid Infusion Therapy</li>
                </ul>

                <p>What do we offer incoming physicians? The possibilities are endless; however, the qualified candidate chosen will receive a highly competitive salary, a weekend call rotation of 1 in 5, and a weekly rounding responsibility of only 1 hospital in any given week. In addition, 4 weeks paid time off (2 weeks vacation, 1 week sick &amp; 1 week for CME). Partnership opportunity with our group can be available in as little as twelve to eighteen months of service. &nbsp;<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    The position we are currently recruiting for requires an individual with the ability to work as part of a collaborative team consisting of physicians, physician assistants, medical assistants, and clerical staff. The recruited physician will enjoy the ease of daily operations with fully integrated electronic health records, a state-of-the-art, modern gastrointestinal diagnostic center and a fully accredited endoscopy and surgery center. EUS &amp; ERCP trained candidates are a plus.<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    Why consider Houston?&nbsp;<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    When people think of a thriving, up and coming city, they usually don&#39;t think of Houston... however, take another look... Houston is an economic juggernaut! Houston is by far the country&#39;s number one city for new job creation in the market; it is the home of America&#39;s booming energy industry, is more diverse than New York City and lets you stretch a paycheck farther than anywhere else in the country. Add that to a thriving restaurant and cultural scene, over 50K acres of parks across the city and 19 museums, and you have a winning case for Houston as the best American city.<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    If you&rsquo;re looking for a position in a thriving economy, in a beautiful city with plenty to offer, with warm weather and endless opportunities for growth, then this may be the perfect position to consider.
