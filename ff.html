					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.oldaga.browsermedia.com/13thissuecover.jpg" target="_top"><img src="http://www.oldaga.browsermedia.com/13thissuecover.jpg" style="padding-bottom: 10px; padding-right: 10px; float: left; width: 76px; height: 100px;" /></a>Each May, <em>Gastroenterology </em>publishes a special 13th issue that examines a major topic that impacts the science and practice of gastroenterology from a variety of perspectives. This year&rsquo;s issue, &ldquo;Food, the Immune System and the Gastrointestinal Tract,&rdquo; reviews the latest research in how food and nutritional elements influence health and disease.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In conjunction with Editor-in-Chief Bishr Omary, PhD, MD, the 13th issue was developed by expert Associate Editors Douglas A. Corley, MD, PhD, from Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, CA, and Detlef Schuppan, MD, PhD, from Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA and the University of Mainz Medical Center in Mainz, Germany. Drs. Corley and Schuppan collaborated with internationally renowned authorities in their respective fields to create a comprehensive issue covering the immunology, biological mechanisms and latest clinical study findings related to the health effects of food and food-related diseases.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The issue is divided into eight main topics:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>1. Food and the Microbiome</li>
						<li>2. Food Allergies</li>
						<li>3. Eosinophilic Esophagitis</li>
						<li>4. Food and Functional Bowel Disease</li>
						<li>5. The Clinical Spectrum and Management of Celiac Disease</li>
						<li>6. Non-Celiac Gluten and Wheat Sensitivity</li>
						<li>7. How the Brain Responds to Nutrients</li>
						<li>8. Nutrients and GI Malignancies</li>
						<li>&nbsp;</li>
					</ol>

					<p>The editors hope this special issue will inform future research by identifying gaps in knowledge, while providing both patients and clinicians with evidence-based summaries and clinical recommendations on the interactions of food and the GI tract. <a href="http://www.gastrojournal.org/issue/S0016-5085(15)X0005-9" target="_top">Access this special issue now</a>.</p>

				<p>Various types of liver disease are associated with an increased prevalence of colorectal adenomas. Philip Jeschek and colleagues investigated whether cirrhosis is a risk factor for colorectal neoplasia by analyzing colonoscopy findings from two cohorts of patients awaiting liver transplantation. Reporting in <em>Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</em>, they find that, based on a retrospective analysis of colonoscopy findings from patients awaiting liver transplantation, those with alcoholic or viral cirrhosis are at higher risk of developing colorectal neoplasia and should be considered for earlier colonoscopy examination.</p>

				<p>Hyperhomocysteinemia is often associated with liver and metabolic diseases. Hiroyuki Tsuchiya and colleagues studied nuclear receptors that mediate oscillatory control of homocysteine homeostasis in mice. Publishing in <em>Gastroenterology</em>, they report that disruption of <em>Shp </em>in mice alters timing of expression of genes that regulate homocysteine metabolism and the liver responses to ethanol and homocysteine. SHP inhibits the transcriptional activation of <em>Bhmt </em>and <em>cystathionine &gamma;-lyase</em> by FOXA1.</p>

				<p>Alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical syndrome characterized by jaundice and liver impairment that occurs in patients with a history of heavy and prolonged alcohol use. The short-term mortality among patients with severe disease exceeds 30 percent. Prednisolone and pentoxifylline are both recommended for the treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis, but uncertainty about their benefit persists. Mark R. Thursz and colleagues&nbsp;report in <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>&nbsp;that pentoxifylline did not improve survival in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Prednisolone was associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality that did not reach significance and with no improvement in outcomes at 90 days or 1 year.&nbsp;</p>

				<h3><a href="/journals-publications/aga-edigest/archive/aga_edigest_april_30_2015" name="news-item-4086" target="_top">Are Pathology Client Billing Arrangements Legal?</a></h3>

				<p>The Office of the Inspector General&rsquo;s most recent <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/docs/advisoryopinions/2015/AdvOpn15-04.pdf" target="_top">advisory opinion</a> on pathology client billing arrangements has implications for gastroenterologists who purchase outside laboratory services. Client billing is a discount arrangement in which a laboratory sells its services at a discounted rate to the physician ordering the test instead of billing the commercial payor directly. This arrangement has come under scrutiny, because the ordering physician bills the patient&rsquo;s insurance for the laboratory services, typically at a higher rate than the physician pays the laboratory.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Gastroenterologists who have an existing pathology client billing arrangement can take the following steps to make sure they are in compliance:</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<ul>
					<li>1.&nbsp; Review the manner in which the physicians in your practice receive direct compensation and whether it varies based on the volume and value of their referrals for laboratory services. It is a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute for a laboratory&rsquo;s discounts for commercial-pay patients to be linked to the referral of Medicare business.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>&nbsp;</li>
					<li>2.&nbsp; Be wary of laboratories that offer to provide all necessary laboratory services, regardless of whether the patient&rsquo;s commercial insurance requires use of a different laboratory, as this could result in the provision of services to patients in exclusive plans for free. Use of a single laboratory under this arrangement could result in inappropriate steering of patients, including federal health-care program beneficiaries.</li>
					<li>&nbsp;</li>
					<li>3.&nbsp; Review existing client billing arrangements with experienced health-care regulatory counsel to discuss any increased liability exposure.</li>
					<li>&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a href="/journals-publications/aga-edigest/archive/aga_edigest_april_30_2015" name="news-item-4087" target="_top">CMS Allows MACs to Change Coding on Physician Claims</a></h3>

				<p>Beginning May 4, CMS will allow Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) to up code or down code claims and adjust provider payments accordingly when the medical record supports such a change. However, this excludes determinations made by contractors based on whether or not the item or service is &ldquo;reasonable and necessary&rdquo; under current CMS policy. Contractors are not allowed to substitute the payment amount for a different amount when the determination is based on the item or service not being medically necessary under the circumstances.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Gastroenterologists should take steps to insure that all services provided and procedures performed are fully documented in the medical record.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Transmittals/Downloads/R585PI.pdf" target="_top">Transmittal 585</a> states:</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&ldquo;In certain situations, it is appropriate for contractors to up code or down code a claim (or items or services on a claim) and adjust the payment. When the medical record supports a higher or lower level code, the MACs, Supplemental Medical Review Contractor (SMRC), Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT), Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPICs)&nbsp;and Recovery Auditors shall not deny the entire claim but instead shall adjust the code and adjust the payment. The MACs, SMRC, CERT, ZPICs and recovery auditors shall up code or down code when it is possible to pay for the item or service actually provided without making a reasonable and necessary determination or if otherwise specified in applicable CMS medical review instructions. The MACs, SMRC, CERT, ZPICs and recovery auditors shall not substitute the payment amount of one item or service for a different item or service based on a reasonable and necessary determination.&rdquo;</p>

				<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>

				<p>AGA will continue to monitor this issue and report more information on how the notice of up or down coding will be provided and what actions providers can take when these actions occur.</p>

				<p>House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Fred Upton, R-MI, and Democratic member Diana DeGette, CO, released a discussion draft legislation of <a href="/take-action/top-issues/patient-access" target="_top">21st Century Cures</a>&nbsp;legislation, which is aimed at modernizing our country&rsquo;s health-care innovation infrastructure. The legislation is the culmination of more than a year of field hearings around the country during which Chairman Upton and Rep. DeGette met with researchers, investors, innovators, patients, regulators and providers to discuss the current environment for getting innovative therapies and products to market and how the process can be improved to advance patient care.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Key highlights of the 21st Century Cures discussion draft include:</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<ul>
					<li>1. Increasing funding to NIH by $10 billion over the next five years.</li>
					<li>2. Providing incentives to young investigators and young scientists.</li>
					<li>3. Increasing loan repayment programs for young investigators.</li>
					<li>4. Language recognizing the importance of NIH officials&rsquo; ability to attend scientific research conferences.</li>
					<li>5. Streamlined approval process for antimicrobials to combat antibiotic resistance.</li>
					<li>6. Improvements to and an expedited approval process for lifesaving medical devices.</li>
					<li>7. Modernization of clinical trials.</li>
					<li>&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The committee plans to continue holding hearings on their discussion draft and will be seeking input from stakeholders, such as AGA. We will review the draft and provide input on areas that are important to gastroenterology, including ensuring that our patients have access to lifesaving technologies.</p>

Wallace professor of medicine and cancer biology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, TN. Dr. Corley is a Research Scientist III at Kaiser Permanente Division of Research; co-chair of research at <span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Kaiser Permanente San Francisco Medical Center</span>; and a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>This is the first time AGA has chosen an editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief to work together to lead <em>Gastroenterology</em>. Dr. Peek and Dr. Corley each applied separately for editorship of the journal, but members of AGA&#39;s editor-in-chief selection committee were greatly impressed by the strategies and vision for the journal outlined in each of their applications. The AGA Institute Governing Board decided to ask Drs. Peek and Corley to work together as editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief, merging their teams to achieve the broadest range of clinical and basic research expertise. Drs. Peek and Corley each bring a wealth of experience and complementary expertise to the journal, both having served AGA in numerous committee and leadership roles. Dr. Corley is also an associate editor on the current <em>Gastroenterology </em>board of editors.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>In response to the appointment, Dr. Peek said, &ldquo;I am honored and extremely grateful to be given the opportunity to serve as editor-in-chief of <em>Gastroenterology </em>and to create a new paradigm for the journal in close collaboration with Doug Corley and our remarkable board of editors. I am also humbled in light of the exceptional job that Bishr Omary and the current <em>Gastroenterology</em> editorial team have done with the journal. Our team shares an unequivocal commitment to advancing the journal over the next term and we look forward to serving as passionate ambassadors and stewards for the dissemination of the best science in the field of GI.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Dr. Corley added, &ldquo;It is truly a privilege to help Dr. Peek lead the next iteration of <em>Gastroenterology</em>. The new board of editors will include a remarkable group of experts from centers of excellence around the world, to help the journal provide the best clinical and basic science manuscripts for our readers. It is exciting to work on new changes, to supplement the advances made by Dr. Omary, for features that even better serve the journal&#39;s diverse constituencies, including international readers, scientists, trainees and clinicians in practice. It is also always helpful to hear from our AGA members and readers regarding what improvements they would like to see.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Dr. Peek and Dr. Corley will begin their transition to the journal in January 2016, and their first issue as editors of <em>Gastroenterology </em>will be published in July 2016.</p>

Physical examination showed no relevant signs. Laboratory data were significant for hemoglobin level (8.8 g/dL), iron level (19 mg/dL), transferrin saturation index (24 percent), ferritin level (9 mg/dL) and hypoalbuminemia (2.9 mg/dL). Upper endoscopy showed giant folds with congestive features (erythema and friability), and large polypoid lesions with oozing bleeding allocated in the fundus and body of the stomach (Figures A and B). Biopsy examinations showed focal foveolar hyperplasia with cystic dilatations, superficial erosions, edematous stroma, smooth muscle hyperplasia, clusters of eosiniphils and a lack of oxyntic glands (Figure C). <em>Helicobacter pylori </em>was not detected in any sample. Colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy did not show any potential bleeding lesions. Oral and intravenous iron therapy was initiated with poor analytic and clinical response.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Within two years of follow-up evaluation the patient was re-admitted several times because of gastric bleeding and progressive clinical deterioration (severe anemia, hypoproteinemia and desnutrition, edema and pleural effusion). After alternative treatments with proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists and somatostatin analogues failed to control the disease and symptoms, therefore surgery was proposed. A total gastrectomy was performed, and after six months the patient showed normalization of analytic parameters and a marked improvement in his quality of life.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>The patient is diagnosed with M&eacute;n&eacute;trier disease, a rare acquired disorder with an unknown origin. Despite its benign nature, it seems to increase the risk of gastric cancer. To learn more about M&eacute;n&eacute;trier disease, continue reading this case in&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565%2814%2901724-8/fulltext" target="_top">Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</a>.</em></p>

				<p>Over the last few weeks we&rsquo;ve previewed sessions one and two of the 2015 James W. Freston Conference: <em>A Renaissance in the Understanding and Management of IBS</em>, which will take place Aug. 29 and 30, 2015. This week we&rsquo;ll take a look at session three to provide you with insight on what to expect when you attend.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p><strong>Motility and Sensory Abnormalities in the Colon and Pelvis </strong><br />
					Session three will provide a more in-depth understanding of the role motor function and stimuli play in diagnosing and treating IBS. Satish Rao, MD, PhD, AGAF, kicks things off by examining how physiological tests have provided mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of colonic dysmotility in IBS and constipation. These insights aid in symptom management.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Guy Boeckxstaens, MD, PhD, will follow with examining the mechanisms of visceral hypersensitivity.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Finally, Frank Tu, MD, MPH, will close out the session by examining the mechanisms of overlapping pelvic pain disorders. Dr. Tu will review experimental and clinical evidence for modifiable cross-sensitization of pelvic organ sensory innervation as well as highlight candidate mechanisms underlying this observation.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>The series will continue with details on session four in the May 14 issue of <em>AGA eDigest.</em> View the program in its entirety and register at <a href="/education-meetings/live-meetings/james-w-freston-conference/2015-james-w-freston-conference-a-renaissance-in-the-understanding-and-management-of-ibs" target="_top">www.gastro.org/frestonibs</a>.</p>

				<p>Merced is a growing city of 82,000 with a new 190-bed hospital and a University of California campus, both of which have attracted a large number of physicians to our community. The UC is also planning for the development of a medical school. Merced is located in an ideal setting that offers the best of both worlds: close proximity to all the amenities of large metropolitan areas and the low cost, low stress environment of a family-oriented Central CA community. A short two-hour drive will get you to San Francisco; the quaint coastal towns of Monterey and Carmel; and Sacramento, the state capital. We are a short drive to Yosemite with all its grandeur and recreational options, and Tahoe is a four-hour drive for great summer and winter recreation activities.
