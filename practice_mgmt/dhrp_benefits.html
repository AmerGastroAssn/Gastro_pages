<h1>Benefits of Participating in DHRP</h1>

<p>The AGA&#39;s Digestive Health Recognition Program&trade; (DHRP) provides clinicians with a way to gain public recognition
    for excellence in quality, and potential incentives from health payors. The DHRP supports the submission of data to the
    Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to meet requirements for the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS)
    and avoid reimbursement penalties for non-participation.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Satisfy PQRS Requirements and Avoid Penalties</h4>

<p>The DHRP provides the fastest, easiest way to meet PQRS requirements and potentially avoid Medicare Part B reimbursement
    penalties through which, your PQRS measures are calculated and sent to the CMS on your behalf. Participation in PQRS
    requires only a minimum of 20 charts, unlike other programs such as claims reporting that require 50% or greater of your
    Medicare Part B patients to be reported.</p>

<h4>Improve Quality with Peer-To-Peer Networking</h4>

<p>DHRP also provides participants with access to CECity&#39;s MedConcert platform, an integrated community of clinicians dedicated
    to improving health quality. MedConcert provides a Facebook-style community within which you can exchange ideas, discuss
    challenges, and professionally network with other quality-minded clinicians.</p>

<h4>Save Time, Save Effort with One Low Price</h4>

<p>For all of the benefits listed above, AGA members pay only <strong>$300</strong>. Non-AGA members are welcome to participate
    for a fee of $550.</p>
