<p>MACRA (Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015) replaces the flawed sustainable growth rate (SGR) and significantly changes the way Medicare pays physicians.</p>

<p>The <a href="/news_items/macra-final-rule-2017-is-a-transition-year">MACRA final rule</a>, released in October 2016, confirmed that the first performance period begins Jan. 1, 2017, which CMS describes as a &ldquo;transition year.&rdquo; The final rule provides additional details following the <a href="http://blog.cms.gov/2016/09/08/qualitypaymentprogram-pickyourpace/">Sept. 8 announcement</a> that CMS will allow physicians to pick their pace of participation&nbsp;for the first performance period.</p>

<p>It is important to understand what is proposed and to ensure you have done everything required under the current rules in 2016.</p>

        <h5>Established through the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), the Quality Payment Program (QPP) is comprised of two tracks: the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and Advanced Alternative Payment Models (APMs).</h5>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>It is important to understand the QPP to ensure you are doing everything required. Ignore QPP requirements and you will face automatic reductions to your Medicare payments.</p>
